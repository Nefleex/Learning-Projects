# Learning-Projects
Used to upload my projects I have created for learning.


LoginApp is a java program that consist of two classes: one class for each JFrame. First frame is Login frame which will
ask user for username and password. Since no account yet exists, you have to click "HERE" element to bring up the second frame
Account Creation. 

Here you will enter your personal details.

The program saves two last fields "Username" and "Password" to variables once user clicks Create Account button.

Create Account button also disposes of current Account Creation window and brings up a new Login frame.

Once username and password are created with Account Creation, they can now be used to successfully login by entering 
them into the text fields and clicking Login. This is prompt a dialog "Login successful".
